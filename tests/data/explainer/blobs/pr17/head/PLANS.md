# Implementation plans

## Invitation shortlist

Summary: build one deterministic, private invitation shortlist from the approved live source export and explicitly attested current qualification evidence. Keep replies, first-DM research orchestration and publication in subsequent slices.

- [x] Ground complete live snapshots and existing generic Supabase prospects/events at runtime `817fe2d`. The owner-approved encrypted source run 36994464162 passed; plaintext stays local and private.
- [x] Compare designs. Choose a typed pure shortlist result behind one input boundary and a thin private-file CLI. Exact profile identities determine exclusions; verified company aliases determine cap allocation; each rank factor retains evidence or an explicit unknown reason.
- [x] Write the E2E failure cases before implementation. Exercise the real CLI and repository client data shapes; keep repeatable evidence free of member records.
- [x] Implement source validation, historical exclusions, qualification gates, all-history event bindings, deterministic ranking and private report/audit plans.
- [x] Verify the private live export and actionable research queue. Run lint, typecheck, E2E/full tests and build. The all-history audit correctly withholds recommendations until event-specific employer research is supplied. Independent review accepted the complete-source and historical identity gates. The parent reran 47 scenario checks, the CLI wrapper, 22 full-suite checks, scoped lint, 12-file typecheck and both package builds. The raster infographic is included for PR publication.

The source snapshots retain no provider generation timestamp. Show this uncertainty separately from acquisition time and complete transport. The collector's `M/D/YY, h:mm AM/PM` dates retain provider-local calendar-day precision with unknown timezone. Supabase invitation timestamps count only when their payload states actual-event semantics; observation times remain unknown. Existing imported research fields contain alignment errors and are not automatically qualification facts. A caller-attested cited envelope must bind exact profile, current role, US location, PVF employer and verified company aliases. The builder validates citation structure and dates but does not fetch the cited pages. No acceptance probability is claimed.

The user selected all-history. Every outgoing invitation event, including a dated CRM send, needs an exact-profile, event-date-specific cited employer binding. CRM's current Company value, acceptance, and connection status cannot satisfy that binding. Unknown or unsupported history withholds all recommendations and preserves source pointers in the private research queue.

Throughput checkpoint:
- Completed gates: complete live read, failing E2E before implementation, all-history scope, event-date semantics, private audit-only run, and local lint/type/test/build checks.
- Independent workstreams: one exclusive implementation owner builds the shortlist; parent researches qualification; a read-only reviewer challenges identity, cap and source gates.
- Shared mutable state: the implementation owner alone edits this branch. Private research and source files stay outside the Git checkout. Pushes and report writes remain serialized.
- Smallest safe decomposition: one shortlist feature with pure decision logic, private-file CLI, docs and E2E. No migrations, new production dependencies, schedules or outreach sends.

## Inbox evidence and actionable report

Summary: add the first reviewable prerequisite for the owner's two-list report. Preserve private message observations for existing prospects without treating unknown invitation notes as confirmed DMs. The complete desired report contract is in `docs/action-report-contract.md`.

Owner clarification: automatically generate only researched first-DM drafts, with a personalized opener grounded in persisted Clay, Exa, or other provider evidence. Reply and follow-up rows show conversation evidence and action reminders; the owner writes those messages. Sending remains manual. Preserve the invitation ranking and Supabase audit requirements.

UTC correction checkpoint (`5cc2381`): 39 synthetic HTTP-boundary inbox scenarios, all 32 existing report E2E scenarios, and 20 pytest checks passed at that revision. Scoped Ruff passed while excluding the unchanged existing quoted-annotation rule. Full-source mypy plus the CLI and live verifier passed across 10 files. The package built successfully. Independent review accepted the whole-thread taint, subject-identity, and explicit UTC-format corrections. The observed provider string fields are covered by fixtures. The implementation has no schema, workflow, schedule, or outreach-send change; the separately approved one-time workflow verified actual inbox persistence. The later review-repair checkpoint below records the expanded suites.

The live verification utility compares complete stored payloads and all event timestamps, preserving earlier observation times on idempotent replay. Its missing-credentials path emits only a fixed failure message. The approved live run https://github.com/komaksym/linkedin-mdp/actions/runs/36985062303 verified persistence, full private readback, and duplicate-free frozen-snapshot replay at revision `5cc23814450c14b4a8d3312c682b5f65fa87e22c`. Updated PR CI run 36985032311 passed. Actual DM queue readiness remains pending reliable message classification and coverage checks. A pytest entry point repeats the existing E2E runner in PR CI without changing workflow infrastructure.

Applied principles: Model the Domain keeps event bodies in `InboxSyncPlan` and sanitized counts in `InboxSyncSummary`. Sequence Work into Verifiable Units makes inbox evidence the first slice before ranking, research, and action publication.

### Prospect date-added report enrichment

Summary: expose the existing Supabase prospect `created_at` value as report-only `date_added`. This is the database row creation time; it is not a LinkedIn connection or acceptance date. It must not affect qualification, exclusions, rank, or company capacity.

Failure modes to reject before implementation:

- Missing `created_at`, null, wrong-type, malformed, or timezone-naive values must remain unknown, never be replaced with collection time or another date.
- A future timestamp must remain unknown rather than being rendered as a valid creation date.
- A timestamp string with a valid timezone and no future instant must be preserved byte-for-byte in JSON and Markdown.
- Qualification input must not spoof or override the source prospect timestamp.
- Profile aliases must join through the same canonical profile normalizer, while zero or multiple source rows must not attach an ambiguous prospect ID or pointer.
- One uniquely matched row with invalid/missing time must retain its stable prospect ID and source pointer with a fixed reason, without leaking the invalid raw value.
- Adding or removing `created_at` must not change shortlist membership, ranking, exclusion counts, or company-cap results.
- The private CLI must still emit only fixed stdout and create only private JSON/Markdown files whose date-added values and source pointers match the pure result.

Implementation is one late output-enrichment helper over validated source prospects, preserving existing qualification and ranking decisions. Red-first verification must use the existing whole-CLI E2E matrix before production edits; no schema, workflow, live source call, or new dependency is needed.

Verification, 2026-10-02: all eight new date-added behavior assertions failed against the unchanged implementation; 83 of the existing 84 matrix scenarios remained green. The corrected implementation passes all 91 matrix scenarios, the CLI artifact wrapper, and the full 22-check repository suite. The selected row preserves an exact offset/fraction timestamp and source pointer in JSON/Markdown, while missing, invalid, naive, or future timestamps remain unknown without affecting membership or ranking. Scoped Ruff and strict mypy on the touched module pass; full-source mypy passes across nine modules. Sdist and wheel builds pass. An unfiltered E501 scan reports only pre-existing long lines outside the added sections. The generated artifact contains aggregate verdicts only.

## Google Docs morning report

### Contract

- Add a dependency-light report adapter and orchestration CLI on `feature/google-docs-report`; call `reconcile_connections()` directly and do not change the reconciliation engine.
- `ReportResult` has `COMPLETE`, `BLOCKED`, or `FAILED`, an aware actual run timestamp, and counts only for `COMPLETE`. Provider or incomplete-snapshot failures publish unavailable counts; Supabase/internal failures publish unavailable counts with an explicit uncertain-write warning.
- Google config, refresh auth, document metadata, complete paginated permission privacy, and marker structure are preflighted before reconciliation. The document must be an editable, nontrashed Google Doc with only one owner user permission and no other grants. Recheck the same gate before one atomic marker-region replacement guarded by `requiredRevisionId`; refetch and recheck once only for revision conflict.
- Markers are exact standalone paragraphs `[BEGIN AUTOMATED REPORT]` / `[END AUTOMATED REPORT]` in one tab. Validate uniqueness/order/plain text, use UTF-16 indices, preserve all outside content, notes, and formatting.
- Google failures preserve the previous document and fail the CLI. Public output is fixed generic status text only; never print exception details or report data.
- Add standalone synthetic-transport E2E scenarios with safe repeatable JSON verdict evidence. Add a main-only, opt-in scheduled/manual workflow; share `connections-reconciliation` concurrency with sync, cancel false. No report outputs, caches, artifacts, summaries, or secrets outside the reporter step.
- Document OAuth setup, restricted sharing, seven-day Testing refresh-token expiry, scheduler opt-in, and best-effort static UTC schedule limitations.

### Milestones

1. Write E2E contract scenarios and evidence runner before implementation.
2. Implement report result/publisher, orchestration script, workflow serialization/opt-in, and setup guide.
3. Run standalone E2E scenarios, then repository lint/typecheck/existing tests/build; fix failures.
4. Publish a separate dependent PR with the system infographic; keep scheduling disabled until live OAuth delivery is verified.

### E2E scenarios

- Complete nonempty and complete empty runs publish all six counts and preserve notes surrounding the managed region, including emoji/non-BMP UTF-16 indexing.
- LinkedIn failure and incomplete snapshot publish `BLOCKED` and unavailable counts, then exit nonzero.
- Supabase failure publishes `FAILED`, unavailable counts, and uncertain-write wording, then exits nonzero.
- OAuth/config failure occurs before LinkedIn/Supabase reconciliation; permission inspection paginates fully and rejects any extra/non-user/deleted/unknown grants or bad metadata.
- One revision conflict triggers fresh read, full permission recheck, and one retry; repeated conflict or other Docs failure leaves the old text untouched.
- Redirects, malformed/duplicate/reversed/cross-tab/rich-text markers, or ambiguous document shape fail closed.
- Captured CLI output and `--evidence` JSON contain only fixed statuses and scenario verdicts, never tokens, document contents, counts, provider data, or exception text.

### Verification outcome

- Complete: 25 synthetic HTTP-boundary E2E scenarios, including actual client pagination, database write uncertainty, owner-only and published sharing gates, UTF-16 note preservation, and revision retry.
- Complete: Ruff, scoped mypy, 19 existing tests, workflow YAML contract checks, sdist and wheel build. Whole-source mypy has a pre-existing `client.py:124` type error outside this change.
- Added a credentials-free PR workflow to repeat the synthetic E2E and existing tests.
- Created and read back an owner-only Google Doc, currently marked SETUP PENDING. Its ID and contents are not committed.
- Pending operator setup: durable Google OAuth grant, repository secrets, merge dependency and this PR, manual workflow-to-Doc verification, then schedule opt-in. Synthetic tests do not verify live OAuth delivery.

- Addressed Greptile cleanup diagnostics: LinkedIn and Supabase close failures now emit the same sanitized cleanup status as Google close failures. Two additional pipeline scenarios prove the diagnostic without leaking exception details.

## Snapshot pagination fix

## Prospect evidence resolution

Summary: add one local evidence-file-to-report feature that preserves observations, reconciles current employment from atomic, cited role claims and derives message state per channel. No live storage, transport API, send capability or infrastructure changes. Ground the existing transport/event boundaries, compare a pure resolver with a stateful case service, then implement the chosen caller contract with executable acceptance checks written first.

Milestones: Ground; Sketch and cross-judge at least two structural alternatives; Agree by default; Implement; Scrap only if repeated deviations invalidate the design. The design artifact records accepted deviations before the next implementation unit.

Architecture decision: use the stateless batch-to-report resolver (Candidate A). Candidate B's local `CaseBook` adds a second durable state store, locking, reopen semantics and report/case consistency before this slice has any caller that needs persisted adjudication workflow state. The selected slice keeps review decisions as cited validation records in the input batch, so the same immutable input plus explicit `as_of` always reproduces the same report. Implement it inside the existing `linkedin_mdp_mcp` package to avoid changing package discovery; this is the only structural deviation from Candidate A's standalone top-level package sketch.

Failure scenarios, recorded before implementation:

1. Input order, repeated records or provider page order chooses a different company or erases alternatives.
2. Same-name people or mismatched profile URLs are merged; untrusted host/path is accepted as a LinkedIn person identity.
3. A newer retrieval timestamp, stale enrichment or several vendors copying one source silently wins an employment conflict.
4. Company from one job and title from another become an invented employment record; simultaneous jobs are treated as mutually exclusive without evidence.
5. Research without a citation, reliable effective time or exact identity match resolves a conflict; future-dated or expired evidence is treated current.
6. A draft or planned step counts as sent; an email reply changes LinkedIn state; equal or unknown event times imply an ordered reply.
7. An absent event becomes proof of never-sent, not-connected or unread, or historical connection evidence becomes verified current membership.
8. Duplicate IDs with contradictory content overwrite evidence, or a malformed input yields a successful report.
9. CLI errors print raw evidence or output exists partially after failure; repeated CLI runs cannot be compared through a saved artifact.

Validate narrow acceptance checks first, then lint, typecheck, full tests and package build. Keep synthetic verification separate from live-source claims. Live collector integration remains gated on the existing CONNECTIONS slice.

Summary: `memberSnapshotData` can return overlapping snapshot elements across pages without version metadata that proves which page is current. Merge distinct JSON rows across all returned elements so pagination cannot silently discard data, and make the verifier independent enough to detect the old single-snapshot defect.

### Verification failure modes

1. One snapshot element is selected and distinct rows from another page are dropped.
2. Overlapping snapshot elements duplicate rows in the public result.
3. A unique row can appear on either an earlier or later page, so page order cannot be the oracle.
4. Exact duplicates must collapse while materially different rows remain distinct.
5. Verification must not reuse production JSON canonicalization, or both paths can self-confirm the same defect.

### Milestones

1. Pin the regression where overlapping pages share rows but each can contain distinct data.
2. Merge distinct snapshot rows without changing the public response shape.
3. Make the live MCP E2E derive expected rows with an independent structural-equality oracle and self-check that the old single-snapshot behavior is rejected.
4. Add a Codex project-local `verify` skill that launches, doctors, drives, captures evidence, and cleans up the real MCP service.
5. Prove the skill once end to end, then run narrow tests, full tests, build, live E2E, and PR review.

## Snapshot exhaustion fix

Keep this small fix on PR 5's existing branch, in one commit as requested.

1. Add full-pipeline E2E cases before production edits. Known no-data exhaustion after successful pages must retain rows and publish COMPLETE. First-page no-data, generic later-page 404, non-404 errors, and page-limit truncation must remain blocked.
2. Preserve the structured provider error message and classify only exact known snapshot no-data 404s after successful pages as normal exhaustion. Preserve public signatures and nearby behavior.
3. Run the regression first red, then green. Run scoped lint/typecheck, E2E, existing tests and build. Independently review the diff.
4. Push one commit to the existing PR branch. Use the approved validation workflow to run that exact commit and read back the live Google Doc, including timestamp, status, verified counts, notes and owner-only sharing. Publish sanitized evidence and an updated raster system infographic in the PR.

Throughput checkpoint: implementation and independent review run in parallel; live credentials remain in GitHub, and the test runner keeps report contents out of public logs.

Validation before commit: the regression against the original client failed with expected exit 0 versus actual exit 1 and `morning report: blocked`. The patched client passes all 32 HTTP-boundary E2E scenarios and 19 existing tests. Scoped Ruff, mypy and package build pass. The `processedAt` comprehension received a type-only narrowing correction so the touched client passes mypy. Independent review found no actionable issues. The exact committed SHA will be used for the live report check; its private readback evidence and infographic will be recorded in the PR conversation.

## Inbox evidence sync

### PR 8 review repair

Summary: repair the four reported review findings on the verified owning branch, then babysit the latest GitHub verdict. Preserve the complete report as the next authorized work after this prerequisite.

- [x] Reproduced endpoint/domain pagination escape before the client correction; reject changed scope before any database access, retain valid partial pagination links within the original request scope.
- [x] Reproduced missing-content attachment loss and valid empty-plan verifier failure; keep null/nonstring content invalid and distinguish empty verification from persisted-event proof. The new review runner also fails against original revision `0893b72` and passes against the repair.
- [x] Aligned live-validation documentation with recorded evidence and remaining report work. The report contract already reflected successful live verification.
- [x] First repair checkpoint (`af41b35`): 41 inbox scenarios, 8 review scenarios, 32 report scenarios, 21 pytest checks, lint, types, and build passed. Independent review was clean; all four threads were answered. CI run 36989915353 and live persistence/readback/replay run 36990096445 passed against this revision.
- [x] CodeRabbit follow-up (`c29b06f`): replaced optimization-removable assertions with unconditional checks. The corrupt-readback E2E subprocess under `python -O` failed before the correction and now passes, alongside normal nonempty readback and valid empty verification. This checkpoint had 11 review scenarios; CI run 36991010814 and live readback/replay run 36991082417 passed.
- [x] Inviter identity review correction: the real verifier boundary rejected equivalent apex/www/regional profile URLs before the fix. It now canonicalizes every outgoing inviter with the existing strict profile normalizer before cardinality checks, while invalid and distinct identities remain rejected before writes. The expanded 15-scenario review E2E, 21 pytest checks, scoped Ruff, full-source mypy (10 files), and package build pass. No schema, workflow, or schedule changes.
- [ ] Follow fresh Greptile/CodeRabbit review and CI to merge-ready. Continue one report feature at a time with concrete live artifacts.

- [x] Unicode identity correction: the approved private source export exposed valid non-ASCII profile slugs rejected by the strict normalizer. Three real HTTP-boundary identity/replay cases failed before the correction. Independent review then reproduced silent literal-control removal by URL parsing; four more cases failed before adding the pre-parse guard. The complete inbox suite now has 54 scenarios. Preserve exact code points and equivalent UTF-8 encoding without transliteration. Issue #9 tracks this source-identity gap. Revalidate this revision and follow fresh review before claiming ready.

Throughput checkpoint: root owns client pagination and existing E2E; one repair worker owns inbox content, live verifier and separate E2E files. A read-only worker inventories the next report slice. No shared-file edits or parallel pushes.

### Live timestamp correction

The approved credentialed validation reproduced zero planned events. Read-only diagnostics confirmed supported prospect identities and mapped rows whose dates use `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS UTC`. The ISO-only parser rejected that format. Two new HTTP-boundary persistence/replay assertions failed before changing parsing; the correction accepts only the exact explicit UTC format. Unknown abbreviations, conflicting offsets, invalid calendar dates, and naive timestamp semantics remain covered. At this historical UTC checkpoint the inbox suite had 39 scenarios; later review repairs expand it as recorded above. Lint, types, tests, build, and actual persistence/readback/replay passed for that checkpoint.

### Contract

- Read complete MDP INBOX snapshots through strict element and paging validation before any store write. Preserve no-read-receipt semantics as unknown.
- Plan typed, duplicate-safe `LINKEDIN_MESSAGE_OBSERVED` events only when direction and the exact known prospect peer are established from canonical LinkedIn `/in/` URLs.
- Withhold every message in any conversation whose participant union exceeds two. Never infer direction from names or row order.
- Preserve provider message content and timestamp semantics. Aware timestamps use provider time; naive provider timestamps use the aware observation time and say that local timezone is unspecified.
- Default the CLI to dry-run. Require `--apply` for writes and emit only fixed status output.
- Keep this slice limited to inbox sync code, its CLI, docs, and synthetic HTTP-boundary E2E evidence.

### Milestones

1. Record failure scenarios and run them red against the current code before production edits.
2. Implement the typed event planner, fail-closed snapshot reader, opt-in CLI, and setup/semantics documentation.
3. Run synthetic HTTP-boundary E2E, scoped lint/typecheck, existing tests, and package build. Fix any failures.
4. Save sanitized, repeatable E2E verdict evidence. Leave review, PR publishing, and live sync to the coordinating task.

### E2E failure scenarios

- Preserve exact inbound and outbound 1:1 messages, match only an exact known prospect identity, and replay with no duplicate insert.
- Canonicalize supported LinkedIn profile hosts while rejecting lookalike hosts, credentials, extra path segments, and non-`/in/` profiles.
- Never use names to infer sender direction. Reject self, group, ambiguous, unknown-peer, malformed-row, and malformed-timestamp records with aggregate skip reasons.
- If participant union across rows makes a conversation a group thread, withhold the entire conversation, including rows that look 1:1 in isolation.
- Preserve aware timestamps. For accepted naive local timestamps, use observed time and mark provider-local timezone as unspecified. Keep read state unknown.
- Reject invalid/truncated snapshot envelopes, malformed page elements and links, first-page or generic 404s, and page-limit truncation before prospect lookup or writes. Accept the known late exhaustion 404 after a successful page.
- Verify duplicate-safe persisted event bodies and no writes on preflight failure or dry-run. Sanitize CLI output and keep `--apply` opt-in.

### Throughput checkpoint

- Blocking first steps: record and run the HTTP-boundary scenarios red before production edits.
- Independent workstreams: n/a. The contract couples snapshot validation, planning, and apply behavior, and the clone has one owner.
- Shared mutable state: one owner writes the exclusive clone; plan, scenario runner, implementation, and evidence happen in order.
- Smallest safe decomposition: one implementation owner keeps the 1:1/group/thread safety invariant visible across the single slice.

PR #10 review wave: reproduced 15 failures before production edits across complete empty provider pages, normalized/conflicting CRM send-date labels, imported opt-out flags and non-UTC date precision. Correct interpretation at those input boundaries; preserve strict raw/exported set equality and UTC instant semantics. Expanded the E2E matrix to 70 scenarios. Also reproduced CodeRabbit’s descriptor cleanup failure with a real OS file-size limit; caller-owned descriptor cleanup now preserves the original filesystem error. Parent validation passed all 70 scenarios plus wrapper, 22 full-suite checks, scoped Ruff, 12-file mypy, sdist/wheel and private live-source CLI.

## PR10 current-employer contract amendment

The owner's latest current-employer and read-only report contract supersedes earlier plans for employer-at-invitation proof and recommendation persistence. `qualification.current_employers` maps exact normalized profile identities to a registered company and citations. Count each outgoing person once against that mapped employer across provider, CRM, and actual Supabase invitation evidence. Event dates and prior employers remain audit metadata. They do not decide capacity.

Conflicting or invalid current-employer assignments, and historical send evidence with unknown identity or employer, enter an explicit private queue and withhold all capacity claims. A candidate whose qualification employer conflicts with the mapping is withheld. The report emits no recommendation event plan. Transport freshness, identity normalization, ranking, suppression, connection exclusion, and previously-invited exclusion remain active.

Red-first E2E against `19a769a` produced five expected failures while the prior 70 scenarios passed. The current implementation passes all 75 scenarios. Parent validation passed the 75-scenario matrix plus wrapper, 22 full-suite checks, scoped strict Ruff, 12-file mypy, and sdist/wheel build. The private live-input CLI produced an explicit current-employer queue with no recommendations or event plan and mode0700/0600 artifacts. The qualification envelope is intentionally empty, so no real shortlist eligibility is claimed. The revised raster infographic and reproducible source records are included. Independent correctness review found no actionable defect. PR publication and fresh current-head reviews remain pending; no merge is authorized.

PR10 fresh review audit corrections: six invalid canonical-alias scenarios and one distinct unsupported-key queue scenario failed before production fixes. Queued profiles no longer retain resolved current employer assignments or capacity attribution. Every employer queue entry retains a stable opaque key ID and source pointer.82 scenario matrix plus wrapper,22 full-suite checks, scoped strict Ruff,12-file mypy and package builds pass. No report publication or database writes occurred.

PR10 Unicode repair verification before publication: 84 scenarios plus wrapper, 22 full-suite checks, strict scoped Ruff, 12-file mypy and builds passed before the usage pause. Pending diff inspected on resume; no source behavior changed since that validation. Separate synthetic CLI proof and independent review requested. Fixed fresh CodeRabbit wording finding by spacing adjacent counts in the matrix record.

PR12 review correction: two UTC conversion overflow boundaries and the Markdown prospect-ID provenance assertion failed before the fix (3 failed, 90 passed). The correction catches overflow as invalid_timestamp and prints the prospect ID beside the source pointer. All 93 E2E scenarios, the full 22-test suite, scoped Ruff, 9-file default source mypy and source/wheel builds pass. Independent read-only review found no actionable issue.

## Present employer sets

Summary: preserve single-employer input while charging each exact historical profile once per explicitly present company, without inventing a primary employer.

- [x] Ground/sketch: prior private design compares singular selection with conservative set accounting; owner selected cited assignments sets.
- [x] Blocking first steps: isolate branch and integrate PR10 metadata-hash correction; no live state.
- [x] Independent workstreams: n/a coupled parsing/counting/audit contract has one exclusive owner.
- [x] Shared mutable state: new checkout; private bindings stay outside Git.
- [x] Smallest safe decomposition: one module with source-boundary parsing and existing planner consumers.
- [x] Red-first matrix: seven new cases failed on the singleton implementation; secondary-cap selection also failed before correction. Nine set cases plus inherited checks pass.
- [x] Implement and validate: 105 E2E cases, 22 full-suite tests, scoped Ruff, 10-file mypy, source/wheel builds and diffcheck. Synthetic private CLI and existing combined renderer accept flat multi-employer rows.
- [ ] Parent owns review, infographic/publication and commits; no deployment.

Contract clarification: incomplete sets retain a research reason but are omitted from resolved assignment audits; original qualification retains their positive evidence. This keeps the established unresolved-alias exclusion contract and narrows the preliminary private design's partial-positive audit proposal.

Parent inspected present-set parser, aliases/conflicts, all-history per-company counts and all-employer selection capacity.105E2E/22fulltests/scopedlint/10-filetypes/sourcewheelpassed. Existing combinedrenderer compatibility and private synthetic CLI verified by writer. Inspected native raster copied; private realpeoplebindings excluded. No liveproposaleligibility/publication/storagewrite.
