# Snapshot pagination fix

Summary: `memberSnapshotData` can return overlapping snapshot elements across pages without version metadata that proves which page is current. Merge distinct JSON rows across all returned elements so pagination cannot silently discard data, and make the verifier independent enough to detect the old single-snapshot defect.

## Verification failure modes

1. One snapshot element is selected and distinct rows from another page are dropped.
2. Overlapping snapshot elements duplicate rows in the public result.
3. A unique row can appear on either an earlier or later page, so page order cannot be the oracle.
4. Exact duplicates must collapse while materially different rows remain distinct.
5. Verification must not reuse production JSON canonicalization, or both paths can self-confirm the same defect.

## Milestones

1. Pin the regression where overlapping pages share rows but each can contain distinct data.
2. Merge distinct snapshot rows without changing the public response shape.
3. Make the live MCP E2E derive expected rows with an independent structural-equality oracle and self-check that the old single-snapshot behavior is rejected.
4. Add a Codex project-local `verify` skill that launches, doctors, drives, captures evidence, and cleans up the real MCP service.
5. Prove the skill once end to end, then run narrow tests, full tests, build, live E2E, and PR review.
